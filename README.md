# Weather-prediction-ML-Project
A Machine Learning project for weather prediction using real world dataset. Predicts rainfall(Classification), temperature(Regression).
This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict weather conditions such as rainfall (classification) and temperature (regression) based on historical weather data. The model is trained using various ML algorithms and helps in weather forecasting.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains historical weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall information.
Ensure you download the dataset before running the project. (Provide dataset link if applicable)
